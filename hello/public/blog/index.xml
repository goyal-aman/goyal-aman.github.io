      <description>TLDR; API Gateway can provide caching, logging auth and load balancer distributes traffic between 2 or more servers for high-availability and horizontal scaling.&#xA;Both load balancer and Api gateways are used between web clients and web servers. But they have served different purpose, that is to say, they are not interchangeable.&#xA;Load Balancers Core function of load balancer is to distribute traffic. They receive traffic from web client’s and distribute them between 2 or more web servers.</description>

      <description>TLDR; Any database falls into one of two category OLAP or OLTP — depending on the access pattern for which it is optimised&#xA;Key differences: OLAP vs. OLTP The primary purpose of online analytical processing (OLAP) is to analyse aggregated data, while the primary purpose of online transaction processing (OLTP) is to process database transactions.&#xA;You use OLAP systems to generate reports, perform complex data analysis, and identify trends. In contrast, you use OLTP systems to process orders, update inventory, and manage customer accounts.</description>
