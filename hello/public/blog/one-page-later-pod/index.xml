      <description>One of the early challenges our product teams had was visibility — not having a clear view of how users interact with our product or what their experience looks like. This made it hard for them to plan what to improve next.&#xA;We’re a small, independent team inside Angel One exploring new initiatives and moving fast.

For each new invocation (especially after a cold start), AWS would spin up a new lightweight VM, pull the ZIP file, and execute it.</description>
