      <description>One of the early challenges our product teams had was visibility — not having a clear view of how users interact with our product or what their experience looks like. This made it hard for them to plan what to improve next.&#xA;We’re a small, independent team inside Angel One exploring new initiatives and moving fast. While we operate autonomously, all security standards and org-level policies still apply to us.</description>

In contrast, you use OLTP systems to process orders, update inventory, and manage customer accounts.</description>
