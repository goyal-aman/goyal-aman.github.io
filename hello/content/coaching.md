I enjoy helping people understand things better, get unstuck, and move forward in their careers. If you’re a student or an engineer looking for guidance, I offer one-on-one sessions where we can work through whatever you’re trying to improve.


## How I can help

### For students
- Preparing for your first job  
- Understanding what to study and how to plan  
- Resume review and clean-ups  
- Mock interviews to reduce nervousness  
- Project guidance and portfolio direction  

### For working professionals
- Preparing for a role switch  
- Brushing up on DSA, system design, backend basics  
- Talking through concepts you find confusing  
- Reviewing your resume or past interviews  
- General career guidance and direction  

### For anyone curious
If there’s a topic you want explained — databases, indexing, distributed systems, architecture, etc. — I’m happy to walk through it at your pace.  
No pressure, no judgment, just clarity.

## What sessions are like
They’re simple conversations.  
We pick a topic, walk through it together, and make sure you leave with clarity and a plan for the next step.  
Nothing formal, nothing scripted.
