&lt;p>AI Improved Version&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This paper discusses how AWS rearchitected AWS Lambda to support container images up to &lt;strong>10 GiB&lt;/strong>, compared to the original &lt;strong>250 MiB&lt;/strong> ZIP-based functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Originally, users had to ZIP their code and upload it to S3 to run on Lambda. For each new invocation (especially after a cold start), AWS would spin up a new lightweight VM, pull the ZIP file, and execute it. This worked well because AWS’s global backbone network is fast and 250 MiB is relatively small, keeping cold-start times low (typically ~50ms).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DocumentDB Load Balancing: A Key Learning from Our Load Testing</title><link>https://goyal-aman.github.io/documentdb-load-balancing-a-key-learning-from-our-load-testing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://goyal-aman.github.io/documentdb-load-balancing-a-key-learning-from-our-load-testing/</guid><description>&lt;hr>

&lt;p>API Gateway can provide caching, logging auth and load balancer distributes traffic between 2 or more servers for high-availability and horizontal scaling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both load balancer and Api gateways are used between web clients and web servers. But they have served different purpose, that is to say, they are not interchangeable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Locks are used by processes to acquire exclusive access to resource which are shared among many processes. Exclusive access is required to prevent race conditions which hard debug and nightmare to detect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imagine scenario of an admin is updating an email group by uploading a file. The process works like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All existing users in the group are removed.
New users listed in the file are added in batches (e.g., 10,000 at a time).
Seems straightforward, right? But now, consider what happens if another file is uploaded while the first one is still being processed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding OLAP and OLTP</title><link>https://goyal-aman.github.io/understanding-olap-and-oltp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://goyal-aman.github.io/understanding-olap-and-oltp/</guid><description>&lt;hr>
&lt;h1 id="tldr">TLDR;&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Any database falls into one of two category OLAP or OLTP — depending on the access pattern for which it is optimised&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="key-differences-olap-vs-oltp">Key differences: OLAP vs. OLTP&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The primary purpose of online analytical processing (OLAP) is to analyse aggregated data, while the primary purpose of online transaction processing (OLTP) is to process database transactions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You use OLAP systems to generate reports, perform complex data analysis, and identify trends. In contrast, you use OLTP systems to process orders, update inventory, and manage customer accounts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Load Balancer vs. API Gateway: Understanding the Differences</title><link>https://goyal-aman.github.io/load-balancer-vs.-api-gateway-understanding-the-differences/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://goyal-aman.github.io/load-balancer-vs.-api-gateway-understanding-the-differences/</guid><description>&lt;hr>

&lt;p>Relational databases can have one primary index and any number of secondary indexes. When queries uses indexes they use keys in the index to find values. There are two ways to have values&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Store actual row in index&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Store reference to rows in index&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Storing references to rows in index is a good when there are any secondary indexes. In this way when a value needs to be updated in row, it can be updated in one place and all the indexes can refer to that one value. Also transactional guarantees are easy to implement in this case. However, challenges may arrive when size of updated row is much larger then original row size that it cannot fit in its current heap location, in which case, row need to move to new location in heap. This requires either updating references in all secondary indexes to new location or leaving a forwarding pointer behind. In normal cases, however, hopping from indexes to heap for reads is too much of performance penalty.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Databases: Memory and Disks</title><link>https://goyal-aman.github.io/databases-memory-and-disks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://goyal-aman.github.io/databases-memory-and-disks/</guid><description>&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Most databases rely on disks and SSD’s to store both data and data structures like table, rows, indexes. There are primarily two reasons for this: disk’s and SSD’s are persistent (or durable) that means data is not lost in case of power loss and they are much cheaper than ram for per Gb cost. Relying on persistent storage devices though comes with challenges. Data in memory needs to be encoded into certain format before it can be written on to them which is slow and CPU intensive.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
